# This program is heavily based on MJRoBot's OpenCV facial recognition tutorial.

# I only edited the a little bit of the code to make it easier for me to use. 
# Core code are from MJRoBot's tutorial. Thank you so much for that helpful tutorial!

# Feature 1: This modified database.py will detect if user entered an empty name and return a warning.
# Feature 2: Pictures will now save to a directory that have the same name with user's ID.
# Feature 3: I added a few more warnings, signals, or you can call [INFO]s, to make my OCD better.

IT'S MY FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM. I DON'T CONSIDER EFFICIENCY A DARN THING.
